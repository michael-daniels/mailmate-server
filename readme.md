# Mailmate

A SaaS (software as a service) that helps automate and expedite the mailing of physical documents. This web application allows the user to upload an infinite list of contacts and an endless number of document templates which they can then pair with selected contacts for mass mailings. All mail fulfillment is handled by a third party, taking a tedious manual process off of the user's hands.
